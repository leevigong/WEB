        <h2>JavaScript이란 무엇인가?</h2>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank" title="JavaScript">JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as  <strong>JS</a></strong> is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
        JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[10] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.</p>
